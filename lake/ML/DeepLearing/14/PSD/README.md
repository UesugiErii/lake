I run his code in tensorflow-predictive-sparse-decomposition.ipynb

And his and my result image is vague, I think only in this way can get a minimum loss for all numbers

Looking directly at the naked eye, you might think the result is exactly the same, but there are actually subtle differences(you can try to compare by using numpy)
