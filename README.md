## What's this repository?

This repository is used to store code, some knowledge and relevant information.

**Please use the search function to search for the code, Some codes may be difficult to find by manual search (because there will be many many codes in the future)**

In the past, I deleted a lot of code that I thought was useless at the time, but now I regret it a little bit. So all my code will be synchronized to this repository in the future, and will never be deleted.
